project & learning notes

My first step was to reference the Google HTML/CSS style guide to glean some
improvements and standards I can adopt in my daily practice. Omit optional html
tags, omit type attributes, and omit protocol in certain embedded resources.

How do I know which CSS length unit to use? If the output environment is likely
to change then relative, not absolute, length units will better scale to new
output environments. But how do you judge between all of the different relative
length units? When do you choose a percentage unit instead of a length unit?
Unclear on those issues.

I'm using html5 custom data attributes to provide d3 with something unique to
select, but I haven't yet solved how to return a selection that is only the
desired element.
