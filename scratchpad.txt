project & learning notes

My first step was to reference the Google HTML/CSS style guide to glean some
improvements and standards I can adopt in my daily practice. Omit optional html
tags, omit type attributes, and omit protocol in certain embedded resources.

How do I know which CSS length unit to use? If the output environment is likely
to change then relative, not absolute, length units will better scale to new
output environments. But how do you judge between all of the different relative
length units? When do you choose a percentage unit instead of a length unit?
Unclear on those issues.

I'm using html5 custom data attributes to provide d3 with something unique to
select, but I haven't yet solved how to return a selection that is only the
desired element.
  + custom data attributes
  + web IDL (interface definition language) - dataset IDL
  + d3.selection.datum([value])
This appears to be a bit of an unnecessary rabbit hole since I can use
selection.filter to filter the array of bound data and return specific elements
of the array, e.g., selection.filter(function(d) { return d == 'd'; }); to return the element
bound to the letter 'd'. The filter method filters the selection and returns
only the elements for which the specified selector is true.
  +d3.selection.filter(selector)

To rotate and adjust the letter down into proper position both the rotate and
translateY values must be included in the same css declaration block or the
property values will overwrite one another, see
//stackoverflow.com/questions/16795548/rotate-and-translate.

The next difficulty is how to transform a transformed element without resetting
the computed value of the transformed element's 'transform' property?
